# LangGang

> **Infrastructure for the Next Wave of AI Builders**

LangGang is building the developer infrastructure for AI systems — starting with **LangGang Core**, an open-source framework for constructing type-safe, modular AI workflows.

Our focus is on making AI development **predictable, composable, and production-ready**.

## 🧠 The Core Idea

Most AI frameworks today are glued together with duct tape — dynamic typing, hidden state, magic strings, and unpredictable behavior.  
LangGang takes the opposite approach: **strong typing, explicit validation, and clear orchestration.**

We believe the next leap in AI won’t come from bigger models.  
It’ll come from **better tools** — tools that make AI development feel like software engineering again.

## ⚙️ What We’re Building

### **LangGang Core**
A Pydantic-based framework for constructing AI workflows as composable, type-checked graphs.  
Built for Python 3.14+, streaming by default, and focused on developer experience.

**Key Features**
- ✅ **Type-Safe Everything** — Every input, output, and edge is a Pydantic model.  
- ⚡ **Streaming Native** — Real-time token streaming through every node.  
- 🧩 **Pluggable Checkpoint Stores** — File, SQLite, Redis, Postgres, or S3 for persistence and replay.  
- 🔍 **Transparent Execution** — Logs, traces, and validations are first-class concepts.  
- 🪶 **Zero Black Boxes** — Every operation is explicit, inspectable, and reproducible.

## 💡 Why It Matters

Developers are shipping fragile prototypes instead of reliable AI systems.  
LangGang provides the missing layer — a foundation that enforces **structure**, **safety**, and **repeatability** in AI workflows.

We’re building:
- **Predictability** through type-checked nodes  
- **Composability** through reusable, validated workflows  
- **Scalability** through native streaming and checkpointing  
- **Visibility** through structured logging and introspection  

LangGang is not another orchestration layer.  
It’s **software engineering for AI**, done right.

## 🧬 Origin Story

LangGang was founded by **Joshua Szepietowski**, a Staff Software Engineer at NBCUniversal,  
specializing in AI systems and developer productivity. After years of building internal tooling for AI teams,  
he realized that most developers were still operating without type safety, observability, or reliable composition.

LangGang was born to change that.

> “We want to make building with AI feel like programming again — predictable, testable, modular.”

## 🧠 The Logo

The LangGang logo represents the **fusion of human creativity and machine logic** —  
a pink organic hemisphere joined with a blue circuit-like hemisphere.  
It embodies what LangGang stands for: **the balance between intuition and structure.**

## 🌍 Vision

LangGang is building an open, type-safe foundation for the next generation of AI developers —  
a framework where models, tools, and agents can be composed as naturally as software functions.

We’re not chasing hype.  
We’re building the **plumbing** of the AI future.
